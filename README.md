# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for this project was a company named Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial was looking to ensure that all of their communications were secure and that the sensitive information being communicated was protected. They were also looking to be able to perform international transactions and adhere to the international security standards, and being compliant with government standards. Artemis wanted to ensure its client base as well that their systems and programs are protected from external threats such as data breaches and cyber attacks.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

After determining Artemis' needs and their vulnerabilities, I proceeded to perform a manual review of the code provided. After a manual inspection, I went on to static testing of the code as well. For my static testing I performed an OWASP Dependency-Check Maven build. After a manual review and dependency-check, I formed a mitigation plan to my client for next and best steps in addressing all found vulnerabilities. Coding securely is important in that the end users have to be able to trust in the product/program being desinged for them. Clients having trust in their systems and tools adds value to the company by being able to protect not only themselves but also their clients that they serve. If Artemis can rely on their security features in place they can provide and promote a higher standard of security and professionalism to their clients.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found the most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment to be the Maven dependency-check, it was able to confirm a lot the vulnerabilities and areas of concern I saw after manually reviewing the code.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Ways that I increase layers of security was by adding in input validation, adding in stronger authentication processes, enhancing session management, and lastly updating libraries to most recent versions. In the future to assess vulnerabilities I would continue to use the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram. It makes it easy to address the vulnerabilities found and to create a mitigation plan.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, the OSWASP Maven dependencty-check were some resources I used that will be incredibly helpful for future projects that I work on. The diagram to assess the areas of vulnerabilities that apply to each situation, then the dependency check to show areas of potential weaknesses.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show my future employers my knowledge of all the different areas of software security that can come in to play for a project. The next skill of knowledge i would share is my process for resolving and testing for these areas of vulnerabilities. From manual reviews, to static testing, also my expierience in creating an encryption cipher to protect data, and then performing a checksum verification. Lastly I would always stress my understanding that software security is a top priority in all steps throughout the coding process and in developing secure code.
